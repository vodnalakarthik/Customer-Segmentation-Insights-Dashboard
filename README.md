# Customer-Segmentation-Insights-Dashboard
Built a Customer Segmentation Dashboard using Excel, SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and Power BI to analyze spending behavior, income, and peer segments. Enabled interactive filtering to uncover insights for targeted marketing, retention, and upselling strategies.
Project Title: Customer Segmentation & Insights Dashboard
📌 Project Description
The Customer Segmentation & Insights Dashboard is a data-driven business intelligence solution built using Python and Power BI. The goal of this project is to help marketing and sales teams better understand their customer base by analyzing spending behavior, income levels, gender distribution, revenue trends, and customer segmentation compared to their peer groups.

Using a cleaned customer dataset, the project combines data preparation (in Python using Pandas) with interactive dashboard design (in Power BI) to uncover meaningful patterns that can drive targeted strategies, such as personalized promotions, retention efforts, and upselling.

This project simulates a real-world retail or e-commerce use case where decision-makers need quick, visual insights into who their top customers are, how different customer segments behave, and which groups present hidden opportunities or risks.
